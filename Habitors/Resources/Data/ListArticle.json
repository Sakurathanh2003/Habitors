It also depends on how naturally hungry your are in the morning.

This can influence your clothing choices and plans for outdoor activities.\n\n📝Review your to-do list\nTake a moment to review your to-do list for the day. This helps you prioritize tasks, allocate time effectively, and mentally prepare for what’s ahead.\n\nTry using the above methods to change your otherwise chaotic morning. A good morning can brighten your day!\n\n",

Replace screen time with a relaxing activity 30–60 minutes before sleeping.\n\n👥 Practice In-Person Connection: Make time for face-to-face conversations with friends and family to strengthen your relationships and reduce loneliness.\n\nIntegrating even a few of these habits into your week can help you feel more focused, restful, and connected to the present moment.
